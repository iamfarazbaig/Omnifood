# Omnifood
A single landing webpage of a fictitious online food delivery company
I made this webpage as a project of a Udemy Course.
I wasn't able to add the code to enable form submission because Github does not support PHP and provided that this is the only platform that allows free website hosting, this was ideal for me,a person who made and published a website for the first time.
